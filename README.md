## __Deep learning :__

[Projet -- Yelp Multi Label Classification](https://github.com/EmilienN/jedha-projet/tree/master/Projet%20--%20Yelp%20Multi%20Label%20Classification)

Build a model that will predict 9 labels purely (good_for_lunch, good_for_dinner, takes_reservations, outdoor_seating...) from the business photos uploaded by users. (Deep Learning, Transfer Learning, API kaggle)<br/>
<br/>

[Projet -- Object Detection with YoloV3](https://github.com/EmilienN/jedha-projet/tree/master/Projet%20--%20Object%20Detection%20with%20YoloV3)

The detection of objects in an image with Yolov3. (learn how to set up an environment and use a Github project)<br/>
<br/>

## __Machine learning supervised & unsupervised :__

[Projet -- Predicting Credit Card Approvals](https://github.com/EmilienN/jedha-projet/tree/master/Projet%20--%20Predicting%20Credit%20Card%20Approvals)

Build a machine learning model that can predict if an individual's application for a credit card will be accepted. (Logistic Regression)
<br/>
<br/>
[Projet -- Conversion Rate](https://github.com/EmilienN/jedha-projet/tree/master/Projet%20--%20CONVERSION%20RATE)

Build a model that will predict the conversion rate of customers on a website and make recommendations to our marketing team in order to increase our revenue. (Data visualization, Logistic Regression, Random Sampling, Ridge, Lasso, ElasticNet, Random Forest, SmoteTomek)<br/>
<br/>
[Projet -- Fraudulent Activities](https://github.com/EmilienN/jedha-projet/tree/master/Projet%20--%20Fraudulent%20Activities)

Build a model that will predict whether the purchase of a piece of clothing should be considered a fraudulent transaction or not. (Machines Learning Models, Bokeh Map, Adaaboost, XGboost, Staking, Voting, PCA with SMOTETomel, Evaluation report)<br/>
<br/>

[Projet -- Uber Pickups](https://github.com/EmilienN/jedha-projet/tree/master/Projet%20--%20Uber%20Pickups)<br/>

Give recommendations as to where drivers should be in order to maximize their chances of finding a race on schedule and build model to predict number of trips by hours. (K-means, DBSCAN, ARIMA, SARIMA)<br/>
<br/>

## __Data visualization :__

[Mini-Projet -- Exploring 67 years of LEGO](https://github.com/EmilienN/jedha-projet/tree/master/Projet%20--%20Exploring%2067%20years%20of%20LEGO)

Analyze a fascinating dataset on every single lego block that has ever been built!<br/>
<br/>
[Projet -- Speed Dating](https://github.com/EmilienN/jedha-projet/tree/master/Projet%20--%20SPEED%20DATING)

A descriptive analysis of the main factors that influence getting a second appointment. (Data Visualization, Clean Dataset, Storytelling)<br/>
