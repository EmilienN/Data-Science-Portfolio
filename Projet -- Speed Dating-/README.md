## Description of the challenge

We will start a new data visualization and exploration project. Your goal will be to try to understand *love*! It's a very complicated subject so we've simplified it. Your goal will be to understand what happens during a speed dating and especially to understand what will influence the obtaining of a **second date**.

This is a Kaggle competition on which you can find more details here :
