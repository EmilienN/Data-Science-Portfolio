## Fraudulent Activities

### OBJECTIVE

E-commerce sites move a lot of money around. This can lead to significant risks of fraudulent activities, such as the use of stolen credit cards, money laundering, etc.

Fortunately, the Machine Learning can help us to identify these fraudulent activities. All the websites where you have to enter your payment information have a team that deals with managing the risk of fraud via ML.

The goal of this challenge is to build a model that allows you to predict the probability of fraudulent transactions.

### DESCRIPTION

Company X does E-commerce and sells handmade clothing. Your goal is to build a model to predict whether the purchase of a piece of clothing should be considered a fraudulent transaction or not.

Here is precisely what you need to do:

1. For each user, determine the country of origin from his or her IP address.

2. Build a model that predicts whether the activity is fraudulent or not. Also explain your choices/assumptions in terms of false positive and false negative optimization.

3. Your boss would like to understand your model because he is worried about using a _black box_ model. How would you explain it from a user point of view, not a mathematical one. For example, which users can be classified as _risky_?

4. Suppose you can use your model live to make its prediction in real time. From a product point of view, how would you use it? How would you think about the user experience with this product?


### DATA

You can use the following two tables:

Python
Fraud_Data
```

&

Python
IpAddress_to_Country
```
