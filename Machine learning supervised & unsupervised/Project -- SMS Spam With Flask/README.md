# Project - Create a web app in Machine Learning

For this week, our project will consist in creating a web application via the FLASK microframework. There are a lot of different notions to take in hand during this week that's why we propose two projects with different difficulties.


## SMS SPAM DETECTOR

In this project, you will create an application that will allow the user to enter an SMS into a form. Your application will need to be able to read this message and predict whether this text is SPAM or not.
