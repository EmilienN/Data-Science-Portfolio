## Project description

* Competition - https://www.kaggle.com/c/nlp-getting-started

Twitter has become an important communication channel in times of emergency. The ubiquitousness of smartphones enables people to announce an emergency they’re observing in real-time.

But, it’s not always clear whether a person’s words are actually announcing a disaster. The task is to build a machine learning model that predicts which Tweets are about real disasters and which one’s aren’t.

The problem to be solved by this capstone project is how to identify which tweets are about ‘real disasters’ and which one’s aren’t. This project will use data science approach to build a machine learning classifier model to predict which tweets are about ‘real disasters’ and which one’s aren’t.

Result : 99% F1-score and 99,2% Accuracy
