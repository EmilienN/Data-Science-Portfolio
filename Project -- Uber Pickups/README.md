## Using KMeans for Uber Trips

In this project, you will see the power of KMeans in today's world. Imagine that you are Uber and you want to give recommendations as to where drivers should be in order to maximize their chances of finding a race.

We will use the Machine Learning to create this recommendation algorithm.

Take the following dataset: [uber-trip-data](https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/uber-tlc-foil-response/tree/master/uber-trip-data)

 1. Try to see the optimum number of clusters
 2. Find these clusters on a map
 3. Now separate these clusters according to the time of day
 4. See the difference between KMeans and DBSCAN
 5. Predict number of Trips by hours
