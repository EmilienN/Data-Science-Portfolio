# Conversion Rate Challenge


## Objective

Optimizing conversion rates is one of the most important tasks of a data scientist.

That's why we will build a model that will predict the conversion rate of customers on a website and make recommendations to our marketing team in order to increase our revenue.


## Description of the challenge

We have collected data about users of a _anonymous_ company's website. Your project is :

1. Create a model to predict the conversion rate (will the user convert or not?).

2. Find recommendations for the Product & Marketing team to make so that they can improve the conversion rate.

## Data

You can find the data in your Project -- CONVERSION RATE folder.
